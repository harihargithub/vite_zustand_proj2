harihargithub: (base) PS C:\Users\nhari\OneDrive\workspace-spring-tool-suite-4-4.19.0.RELEASE\ems_springboot_react_vite_mysql_sf\vite_zustand_proj2\digital-shop-ls-supabase>  -  earlier digital-shop-ls-supabase project using Vite, Zustand & Synfusion was in different folder and now want to run it here

GitHub Copilot: It seems like you want to run a project that was previously in a different folder. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Navigate to the new project directory in your terminal. You can do this using the `cd` command. Replace `path_to_your_project` with the actual path to your project.

```bash
cd path_to_your_project
```

2. Once you're in the project directory, you need to install the project dependencies. If you're using npm as your package manager, you can do this with the `npm install` command. If you're using yarn, you can use the `yarn` command.

```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn
```

3. After the dependencies are installed, you can start the project. If you're using npm, you can do this with the `npm start` command. If you're using yarn, you can use the `yarn start` command.

```bash
npm start
```
or
```bash
yarn start
```

Please replace the commands with the actual commands if they are different in your project.

harihargithub: npm install done and next please check the shared file and advise

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I can help with that. However, I need to see the content of the shared file to provide accurate advice. Could you please share the content or describe the issues you're facing?

harihargithub: It's package-lock.json which is made active selection

GitHub Copilot: The `package-lock.json` file is an automatically generated file by NPM, which is meant to keep track of the exact version of every package installed in your project. This ensures that you'll use the same package versions across different environments.

The file contains:
- The name and version of every installed package
- The exact tree that was generated when the package was installed
- Information about other metadata such as the package's license, the source of the package, etc.

It's important to commit this file to your version control system to ensure consistent installations across different environments.

harihargithub: Used vite so next can it run as npm run dev

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can run a Vite project with `npm run dev`. However, you need to make sure that the `dev` script is defined in your `package.json` file. 

Here's an example of how you can set it up:

```json
{
  "name": "my-vite-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "serve": "vite preview"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```

In this example, running `npm run dev` in the terminal will start the Vite development server.

harihargithub: [plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "../App" from "src/main.jsx". Does the file exist? so please check following files which are in src folder -
// App.jsx under src folder
// import React from 'react';
import AppRoutes from './AppRoutes'; // Import AppRoutes
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AppRoutes /> {/* Use AppRoutes for routing */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

// App.jsx under src folder
// import React from 'react';
import AppRoutes from './AppRoutes'; // Import AppRoutes
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <AppRoutes /> {/* Use AppRoutes for routing */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing indicates that Vite is unable to find the `App` component from the `src/main.jsx` file. 

Based on the code you've shared, it seems like your `App` component is defined correctly. The issue might be with the way you're importing the `App` component in your `main.jsx` file.

Here's how you can import the `App` component in your `main.jsx` file:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App'; // Import App component

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Please make sure that the `App.jsx` and `main.jsx` files are in the same directory (`src`), and the import statement in `main.jsx` is correct. If the files are in different directories, you need to adjust the import path accordingly.

harihargithub: Please advise fresh code for above based on the main.jsx made active selection

GitHub Copilot: The error you're encountering is due to the incorrect import path for the `App` component in your `main.jsx` file. 

Since both `App.jsx` and `main.jsx` are in the same directory (`src`), you don't need to go up a directory level (`../`) to import `App`. 

Here's the corrected code:

```jsx
//main.jsx under src folder
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App'; // Corrected import path
import './index.css';
import { registerLicense } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

// .env - VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY='Your SF Licence Key'
registerLicense(import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

This should resolve the import error you're facing.

harihargithub: [plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations/styles/material.css" from "src/components/Wrapper.jsx".

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that Vite is unable to resolve the import for the Syncfusion navigation styles. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The package `@syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations` is not installed. You can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations
```

2. The path to the CSS file is incorrect. Make sure that the path `@syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations/styles/material.css` exists in your `node_modules` directory.

3. There's a caching issue. Try deleting the `node_modules/.vite` directory and restarting the Vite server:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

Please try these solutions and see if they resolve your issue.

harihargithub: Please advise if import "../../src/wrapper.css"; is correct?

GitHub Copilot: The import statement seems to be incorrect. It's trying to go up two directories (`../../`) and then back into the `src` directory. 

If your `Wrapper.jsx` file is located in the `src` directory or a subdirectory of `src`, you don't need to go up two directories to import `wrapper.css`.

Here's the corrected import statement if `Wrapper.jsx` and `wrapper.css` are in the same directory:

```jsx
import "./wrapper.css";
```

If `Wrapper.jsx` is in a subdirectory of `src`, you might need to adjust the path accordingly. For example, if `Wrapper.jsx` is in `src/components`, you would import `wrapper.css` like this:

```jsx
import "../wrapper.css";
```

Please adjust the import path according to your project structure.

harihargithub: Wrapper.jsx is under src->components and wrapper.css under src

GitHub Copilot: Given that `Wrapper.jsx` is in the `src/components` directory and `wrapper.css` is in the `src` directory, you should adjust the import statement in `Wrapper.jsx` to correctly point to `wrapper.css`.

Here's the corrected import statement:

```jsx
import "../wrapper.css";
```

This import statement goes up one directory level (from `src/components` to `src`) to import `wrapper.css`.

harihargithub: src->pages>logout.jsx and hooks under root so check useSupabase import

GitHub Copilot: Given that `Logout.jsx` is in the `src/pages` directory and `useSupabase` is in the `hooks` directory at the root level, you should adjust the import statement in `Logout.jsx` to correctly point to `useSupabase`.

Here's the corrected import statement:

```jsx
import useSupabase from '../../hooks/supabase';
```

This import statement goes up two directory levels (from `src/pages` to the root directory) to import `useSupabase`.

harihargithub: Multiple GoTrueClient instances detected in the same browser context. It is not an error, but this should be avoided as it may produce undefined behavior when used concurrently under the same storage key.
supaStore.jsx:9

GitHub Copilot: The warning message you're seeing is due to multiple instances of `GoTrueClient` (which is used by Supabase for authentication) being created in the same browser context. This can happen if you're calling `createClient` multiple times in your application.

In your `supaStore.jsx` file, you're creating a Supabase client:

```jsx
export const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);
```

If you're also creating a Supabase client somewhere else in your application, you'll see this warning message.

To resolve this issue, you should create the Supabase client only once and then import it wherever you need to use it. This ensures that only one instance of `GoTrueClient` is created.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```jsx
// supabaseClient.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const SUPABASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const SUPABASE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_KEY);
```

Then, in your `supaStore.jsx` file, you can import the Supabase client:

```jsx
// supaStore.jsx
import { supabase } from './supabaseClient';
```

Please make sure to replace the paths with the actual paths in your project.

harihargithub: Check following file & the file made active selection please for above issue? -
// hooks/supabase.jsx
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://uyqzpgmjgigdwiygoagg.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY =

const useSupabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

export default useSupabase;


GitHub Copilot: The issue is that you're creating two instances of the Supabase client: one in `supaStore.jsx` and another in `supabase.jsx`. This is causing the warning about multiple `GoTrueClient` instances.

To resolve this, you should create the Supabase client only once and then import it wherever you need to use it. 

Here's how you can modify your `supabase.jsx` file:

```jsx
// hooks/supabase.jsx
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://uyqzpgmjgigdwiygoagg.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY =

export const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);
```

And then import the Supabase client in your `supaStore.jsx` file:

```jsx
//src/supaStore.jsx
import { create } from 'zustand';
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware';
import { supabase } from '../hooks/supabase'; // Import supabase client

let store = (set) => ({
  supabase,
  // ... rest of your code
});

// ... rest of your code
```

Please make sure to replace the paths with the actual paths in your project.

harihargithub: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/hooks/supabase.jsx' does not provide an export named 'supabase' (at supaStore.jsx:5:10)

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `supabase` export is not found in the `supabase.jsx` file. This could be because the `supabase.jsx` file is not exporting `supabase` or the path to the `supabase.jsx` file is incorrect.

Here's how you can export `supabase` from the `supabase.jsx` file:

```jsx

import { create } from 'zustand';
import { persist } from 'zustand/middleware';
import { supabase } from '../../hooks/supabase'; // Import supabase

// ... rest of your code
```

Please make sure that the path to the `supabase.jsx` file is correct. The `../../` in the import statement means that the `supabase.jsx` file should be two directories up from the `supaStore.jsx` file. If the `supabase.jsx` file is not in the `hooks` directory at the root level, you need to adjust the path accordingly.

harihargithub: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/hooks/supabase.jsx?t=1716903689772' does not provide an export named 'default' (at auth.jsx:2:8)

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `default` export is not found in the `supabase.jsx` file. This is because you're trying to import `useSupabase` as a default export, but in your `supabase.jsx` file, `supabase` is a named export, not a default export.

Here's how you can import `supabase` from the `supabase.jsx` file:

```jsx
// hooks/auth.jsx
import { supabase } from '../hooks/supabase'; // Import supabase as a named export
import useStore from '../src/store/supaStore';
import { useState } from 'react';

// ... rest of your code
```

Please make sure that the path to the `supabase.jsx` file is correct. The `../` in the import statement means that the `supabase.jsx` file should be one directory up from the `auth.jsx` file. If the `supabase.jsx` file is not in the `hooks` directory at that level, you need to adjust the path accordingly.

harihargithub: supabase' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)
'supabase' is defined but never used.eslintno-unused-vars
(alias) const supabase: SupabaseClient<any, "public", any>
import supabase

GitHub Copilot: The warnings you're seeing are because you've imported `supabase` but you're not using it in your code. 

In your `signup` and `login` functions, you're using `useSupabase.auth` but `useSupabase` is not defined. You should replace `useSupabase` with `supabase` since that's what you've imported.

Here's how you can modify your `signup` and `login` functions:

```jsx
const signup = async (email, password, firstName, lastName) => {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
      email: email,
      password: password,
      options: {
        data: {
          firstName,
          lastName,
        },
      },
    });
    if (!error) {
      setSignupData(data);
    } else {
      setError(error);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.error('Error while creating an user please try again!');
    setError(e);
  }
};

const login = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({
      email,
      password,
    });

    if (!error) {
      const { session, user } = data;
      setLoginData(data);
      setUserState({
        isLoggedIn: true,
        email: user.email,
        firstName: user.user_metadata.firstName,
        lastName: user.user_metadata.lastName,
        accessToken: session.access_token,
      });
    } else {
      setError(error);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Invalid credentials', error);
    setError(error);
  }
};
```

This should resolve the warnings and make your `signup` and `login` functions work as expected.

harihargithub: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/store/supaStore.jsx?t=1716903689772' does not provide an export named 'supabase' (at ResetPassword.jsx:4:10)

```jsx
// ResetPassword.jsx

```

Please make sure that the path to the `supaStore.jsx` file is correct. The `../` in the import statement means that the `supaStore.jsx` file should be one directory up from the `ResetPassword.jsx` file. If the `supaStore.jsx` file is not in the `store` directory at that level, you need to adjust the path accordingly.

GitHub Copilot: The issue might be due to the route path in your `AppRoutes.jsx` file. In your `AppRoutes.jsx` file, you have defined the route for the signup page as `register`:

```jsx
<Route path="register" element={<Signup />} />
```

But in your `Signup.jsx` file, you are redirecting to `login` after successful signup:

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {
  navigate('/login');
}, 2000);
```

And in the bottom of your `Signup.jsx` file, you are linking to `login` if the user already has an account:

```jsx
<Link to="/login">login</Link>
```

So, if you are trying to access the signup page with the URL `http://localhost:5173/Register`, it will not work because the route for the signup page is defined as `register` (lowercase), not `Register` (uppercase).

URLs are case-sensitive. So, `http://localhost:5173/register` and `http://localhost:5173/Register` are considered different URLs.

To fix the issue, you should change the URL to `http://localhost:5173/register` (lowercase) in your browser to access the signup page.

export default Signup;


GitHub Copilot: The issue seems to be with the case sensitivity of the route paths. In your `AppRoutes.jsx` file, you have defined the route for the signup page as both `Register` and `signup`:

```jsx
<Route path="Register" element={<Signup />} />
<Route path="signup" element={<Signup />} />
```

But in your `Signup.jsx` file, you are redirecting to `Login` after successful signup:

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {
  navigate('/Login');
}, 2000);
```

And in the bottom of your `Signup.jsx` file, you are linking to `Login` if the user already has an account:

```jsx
<Link to="/Login">login</Link>
```

So, if you are trying to access the signup page with the URL `http://localhost:5173/Register`, it will not work because the route for the signup page is defined as `Register` (uppercase), not `register` (lowercase).

URLs are case-sensitive. So, `http://localhost:5173/register` and `http://localhost:5173/Register` are considered different URLs.

To fix the issue, you should change the URL to `http://localhost:5173/Register` (uppercase) in your browser to access the signup page. Also, ensure that all your route paths and redirects are consistent in terms of case sensitivity.

harihargithub: using only http://localhost:5173/Register and signup.jsx not opening

GitHub Copilot: The issue might be due to the fact that you have defined two routes for the same component `Signup` in your `AppRoutes.jsx` file:

```jsx
<Route path="Register" element={<Signup />} />
<Route path="signup" element={<Signup />} />
```

This could be causing a conflict. Try to keep only one route for each component. If you want to keep the `Register` route, you can remove the `signup` route:

```jsx
<Route path="Register" element={<Signup />} />
```

And make sure to use the same case (upper or lower) everywhere in your code when referring to this route. For example, in your `Signup.jsx` file, when redirecting to login, use the same case:

```jsx
setTimeout(() => {
  navigate('/Login');
}, 2000);
```

And when linking to login:

```jsx
<Link to="/Login">login</Link>
```

After making these changes, try to access the signup page with the URL `http://localhost:5173/Register`.

harihargithub: Login also throwing blank page

GitHub Copilot: The code you provided is a React component for a login page. It imports several dependencies, uses a custom hook `useAuth`, and maintains several pieces of state related to the login process.

If you're seeing a blank page when trying to navigate to this component, there could be several reasons:

1. There might be an error in the `useAuth` hook. Check the console for any error messages related to this hook.

2. There might be an error in the `Toast` component. Again, check the console for any error messages related to this component.

3. The route to this component might not be correctly set up in your router configuration. Make sure that there is a route that leads to this component.

4. There might be a problem with the CSS styles that causes the component to be invisible or off the screen. Check the CSS for any issues.

5. There might be an error elsewhere in your application that prevents this component from rendering. Check the console for any error messages.

Without more information, it's hard to say exactly what the problem might be. I recommend checking the console for error messages, and making sure that all dependencies are correctly imported and used.

harihargithub: Providing auth.jsx for above issue 

GitHub Copilot: The `auth.jsx` file you provided defines a custom React hook `useAuth` that provides authentication functionality using Supabase. It exports two main functions: `signup` and `login`, which are used to sign up a new user and log in an existing user, respectively.

If you're seeing a blank page when trying to navigate to the login or signup page, it could be due to an error in this hook. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Supabase client**: Make sure that the Supabase client is correctly initialized in the `supabase.js` file and that the correct URL and public anon key are provided.

2. **Error handling**: The `signup` and `login` functions both catch errors and set them in the `error` state variable. You can display this error in your component to get more information about what's going wrong. For example:

```jsx
const { login, loginData, signup, signupData, error } = useAuth();

if (error) {
  return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
}
```

3. **Store**: The `useAuth` hook uses a store from `supaStore`. Make sure that this store is correctly set up and that the `setUserState` function works as expected.

4. **Data handling**: The `login` function tries to destructure `session` and `user` from `data`, and `firstName` and `lastName` from `user.user_metadata`. Make sure that the data returned from Supabase includes these properties.

Without more information, it's hard to say exactly what the problem might be. I recommend adding more error handling and logging to your code to get more information about what's going wrong.

harihargithub: supabase.jsx is shared to fix above error

GitHub Copilot: The `supabase.jsx` file you provided is correctly setting up the Supabase client. It imports the `createClient` function from `@supabase/supabase-js`, and uses it to create a new Supabase client with the provided URL and anonymous key.

If you're still seeing a blank page when trying to navigate to the login or signup page, it's unlikely that the issue is with this file. Here are a few more things you can check:

1. **Supabase URL and anonymous key**: Make sure that the URL and anonymous key provided are correct. You can find these in the settings of your Supabase project.

2. **Network requests**: Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if the requests to Supabase are going through. If there's an issue with the request, it should show up here.

3. **Console errors**: Check the console in your browser's developer tools for any error messages. If there's an issue with the Supabase client or the `useAuth` hook, it should show up here.

4. **React component tree**: Check the component tree in your browser's developer tools to see if the login or signup component is being rendered. If it's not, there might be an issue with your router configuration.

Without more information, it's hard to say exactly what the problem might be. I recommend adding more error handling and logging to your code to get more information about what's going wrong.

harihargithub: Do you think some syncfusion installs missing?

GitHub Copilot: The `Signup` component you provided uses several Syncfusion components and styles. If these are not installed correctly, it could cause the component to not render properly.

Here are the Syncfusion dependencies that are imported in your component:

```jsx
import '@syncfusion/ej2-layouts/styles/material.css';
import '@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs/styles/material.css';
import '@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css';
import { ButtonComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons';
```

You can check if these dependencies are installed by looking in your `package.json` file. They should be listed under `dependencies`:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@syncfusion/ej2-layouts": "^version",
  "@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs": "^version",
  "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons": "^version",
  ...
}
```

If they are not listed, you can install them using npm:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-layouts @syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs @syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons
```

After installing these dependencies, try to navigate to the signup page again. If you're still seeing a blank page, there might be another issue with your code.

harihargithub: Please here for above 

GitHub Copilot: From the `package.json` file you provided, it appears that all the necessary Syncfusion dependencies are installed:

```json
"@syncfusion/ej2-base": "^24.2.7",
"@syncfusion/ej2-layouts": "^24.2.4",
"@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons": "^24.2.7",
"@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs": "^24.2.7",
"@syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations": "^25.2.6",
"@syncfusion/ej2-react-notifications": "^24.2.4",
"@syncfusion/ej2-react-popups": "^24.2.5",
```

This means that the issue with the blank page is likely not due to missing Syncfusion dependencies.

Here are a few more things you can check:

1. **React and React DOM versions**: You're using version `18.2.0` of both `react` and `react-dom`. This is a pre-release version of React that includes experimental features. Try downgrading to the latest stable version (currently `17.0.2`) to see if that fixes the issue.

2. **React Router version**: You're using version `6.21.1` of `react-router-dom`. Make sure that all your routes are set up correctly according to the documentation for this version.

3. **Formik and Yup versions**: You're using Formik for form handling and Yup for validation. Make sure that these libraries are used correctly in your components.

4. **Console errors**: Check the console in your browser's developer tools for any error messages. If there's an issue with any of your dependencies or your own code, it should show up here.

5. **React component tree**: Check the component tree in your browser's developer tools to see if the login or signup component is being rendered. If it's not, there might be an issue with your router configuration or your component code.

harihargithub: Can I provide the entire Project file in zip format for you to check on above errors please

GitHub Copilot: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to directly access or interact with files on your local system, including zip files. I can provide assistance based on the code snippets or error messages you provide here. If you have any other parts of your code that you think might be causing the issue, feel free to share them and I'll do my best to help.

harihargithub: To fix Login & Register blank page issue can I show files one by one and you please ask next for me to share next file

GitHub Copilot: Absolutely, we can proceed that way. The `Navbar.jsx` file you've shared seems fine. It correctly uses the `Link` component from `react-router-dom` to create navigation links to the `/Register` and `/Login` routes.

The next file I would like to see is your main `App.jsx` (or equivalent) file where you define your routes using `react-router-dom`. This file should contain something like:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Navbar from './Navbar';
import Login from './Login';
import Register from './Register';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Navbar />
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/Login" component={Login} />
        <Route path="/Register" component={Register} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Please share the code for this file or the file where you define your routes.

harihargithub: Next is AppRoutes.jsx

GitHub Copilot: The `AppRoutes.jsx` file you've shared seems to be correctly setting up the routes for your application. The `Login` and `Register` (or `Signup`) components are assigned to the `/Login` and `/Register` paths respectively.

Here are a few things to check:

1. **Component Imports**: Make sure that the `Login` and `Signup` components are correctly imported. If there's an issue with these imports, it could cause a blank page to be displayed.

2. **Nested Routes**: You're using nested routes for the `/` and `/dashboard` paths. Make sure that the `PublicRoutes` and `PrivateRoutes` components correctly render their children.

3. **Route Paths**: The paths for the routes are case-sensitive. Make sure that the paths in your `Link` components match the paths in your `Route` components exactly. For example, if you have a `Link` to `/login`, but your `Route` is set up for `/Login`, the `Login` component will not be rendered.

4. **Default Route**: You have a default route (`/*`) that renders the `NotFound` component. If there's an issue with this component, it could cause a blank page to be displayed.

If everything seems fine with this file, the next files I would like to see are the `PublicRoutes` and `PrivateRoutes` components, as well as the `Login` and `Signup` components.

harihargithub: Next both above files are here -
// public.jsx
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';
import useStore from '../store/supaStore';

const Public = () => {
  const isLoggedIn = useStore((state) => state.isLoggedIn);
  return isLoggedIn ? null : <Outlet />;
};

export default Public;


GitHub Copilot: The `Private.jsx` and `Public.jsx` files you've shared are using the `Outlet` component from `react-router-dom` to render their children. They also use a custom hook `useStore` to check if the user is logged in.

Here are a few things to check:

1. **useStore Hook**: Make sure that the `useStore` hook is correctly returning the `isLoggedIn` state. If there's an issue with this hook, it could cause a blank page to be displayed.

2. **isLoggedIn State**: The `isLoggedIn` state is used to conditionally render the `Outlet` component or redirect to the `/login` page. Make sure that this state is correctly initialized and updated.

3. **Outlet Component**: The `Outlet` component is used to render the child routes. Make sure that the child routes are correctly set up in your `AppRoutes.jsx` file.

If everything seems fine with these files, the next files I would like to see are the `Login` and `Signup` components.

GitHub Copilot: The `Login.jsx` and `Signup.jsx` files you've shared are responsible for the user authentication process in your application. They both use the `useAuth` custom hook to handle user authentication.

Here are a few things to check:

1. **useAuth Hook**: Make sure that the `useAuth` hook is correctly handling the login and signup processes. If there's an issue with this hook, it could cause a blank page to be displayed.

2. **Form Validation**: Both components are validating the email and password fields. Make sure that the validation functions are working as expected.

3. **Toast Component**: The `Toast` component is used to display error messages. Make sure that this component is correctly displaying the error messages.

4. **Navigation**: After successful signup, the user is redirected to the login page. Make sure that the navigation is working as expected.

If everything seems fine with these files, the next file I would like to see is the `useAuth` hook.

harihargithub: here it is

GitHub Copilot: The `auth.jsx` file you've shared is a custom hook that handles user authentication using Supabase. It exports the `useAuth` hook which provides `login` and `signup` functions.

Here are a few things to check:

1. **Supabase**: Make sure that Supabase is correctly initialized and that the `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` and `supabase.auth.signUp` methods are working as expected. If there's an issue with Supabase, it could cause a blank page to be displayed.

2. **Error Handling**: Both the `login` and `signup` functions have error handling logic. Make sure that the errors are correctly caught and set to the `error` state.

3. **User State**: After a successful login, the user state is updated using the `setUserState` function from the `useStore` hook. Make sure that this function is working as expected.

If everything seems fine with this file, the next file I would like to see is the `supabase` initialization file and the `supaStore` file.

harihargithub: Next three files are here -
// hooks/supabase.jsx
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const SUPABASE_URL = 'https://uyqzpgmjgigdwiygoagg.supabase.co';
const SUPABASE_ANON_KEY =

export const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY);

// authStore.jsx

    const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signIn({ email, password });
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error logging in:', error.message);
      return 'Invalid email or password';
    } else {
      set({ isAuthenticated: true, user });
      return 'Logged in successfully';
    }
  },
  logout: async () => {
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signOut();
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error logging out:', error.message);
    } else {
      set({ isAuthenticated: false, user: null });
    }
  },
  register: async (email, password) => {
    const { user, error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password });
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error registering:', error.message);
    } else {
      set({ user });
    }
  },
  resetPassword: async (email) => {
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email, 'http://localhost:5173/update-password');
    if (error) {
      console.error('Error resetting password:', error.message);
    } else {
      console.log('Password reset email sent to:', email);
    }
  },
});

// persist the state with key "auth-store"
authStore = persist(authStore, { name: 'auth-store' });

// create the store
let useAuthStore = create(authStore);

export default useAuthStore;

GitHub Copilot: The `supabase.jsx`, `supaStore.jsx`, and `authStore.jsx` files you've shared are responsible for initializing Supabase and creating Zustand stores for user authentication and state management.

Here are a few things to check:

1. **Supabase Initialization**: The `supabase.jsx` file initializes Supabase with your Supabase URL and Anon Key. Make sure that these values are correct.

2. **supaStore**: The `supaStore.jsx` file creates a Zustand store with user state and functions to update this state. Make sure that the `setUserState` and `logout` functions are working as expected.

3. **authStore**: The `authStore.jsx` file creates another Zustand store with authentication functions. Make sure that the `login`, `logout`, `register`, and `resetPassword` functions are working as expected.

If everything seems fine with these files, the next step would be to check the components that use these stores and hooks. Make sure that they are correctly using the provided state and functions. If you're still facing issues, please provide the error message or describe the issue in more detail.

GitHub Copilot: Based on the project structure you've shared, it seems like your application is well-organized. The authentication-related logic is in the `hooks` and `store` directories, and the user interface is in the `components` and `pages` directories.

If you're still facing issues with the login and signup functionality, I would suggest checking the following files:

1. **AppRoutes.jsx**: This file likely contains the routing logic for your application. Make sure that the routes for the login and signup pages are correctly defined.

2. **signin.jsx** and **signup.jsx**: These are the pages for the login and signup functionality. You've already shared these files, but it might be worth revisiting them to make sure that they are correctly using the `useAuth` and `useAuthStore` hooks.

3. **private.jsx** and **public.jsx**: These files likely contain the logic for private and public routes. Make sure that the private routes are correctly checking the authentication status.

4. **navbar.jsx**: This component likely contains navigation links. Make sure that the links to the login and signup pages are correctly defined.

If you're still facing issues after checking these files, please provide the error message or describe the issue in more detail.

harihargithub: I have shared all files to fix issue with Login & Register pages redering blank and now please advise

GitHub Copilot: Based on the files and project structure you've shared, here are the next steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check the `signin.jsx` and `signup.jsx` files**: These files handle the rendering of the Login and Register pages. Ensure that they are correctly importing and using the `useAuth` and `useAuthStore` hooks. Also, check if there are any rendering issues in these components.

2. **Check the `AppRoutes.jsx` file**: This file likely contains the routing logic for your application. Make sure that the routes for the Login and Register pages are correctly defined.

3. **Check the `private.jsx` and `public.jsx` files**: These files likely contain the logic for private and public routes. Make sure that the private routes are correctly checking the authentication status.

4. **Check the `navbar.jsx` file**: This component likely contains navigation links. Make sure that the links to the Login and Register pages are correctly defined.

5. **Check the console for errors**: If there are any JavaScript errors, they should appear in the console. These errors can give you a clue about what's going wrong.

6. **Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools**: If the issue is related to the API calls to Supabase, you should be able to see the failed requests in the network tab.

If you're still facing issues after checking these files, please provide the error message or describe the issue in more detail.

harihargithub: What is that required to be shared from network tab?

GitHub Copilot: The Network tab in your browser's developer tools can provide valuable information when debugging issues related to network requests. Here's what you should look for:

1. **Failed Requests**: Look for any network requests that are failing. These will typically be highlighted in red. Click on the failed request to see more details. This can often provide clues about what's going wrong.

2. **Request and Response Details**: For each network request, you can see the request headers, response headers, and response body. This can help you understand if the request is being sent correctly and if the server is responding as expected.

3. **API Endpoints**: Check if the correct API endpoints are being called. This can help you identify if there's an issue with the way your application is making requests.

4. **Payloads**: If your requests include a payload (like a POST or PUT request), check if the payload is correct.

5. **Status Codes**: HTTP response status codes can give you a lot of information. For example, a 404 means the requested resource was not found, a 401 means unauthorized, and a 500 means there was a server error.

Please note that sensitive information like access tokens and personal data might be included in these details. Be careful not to share this sensitive information.

harihargithub: Some status are 200 and some 304?

GitHub Copilot: HTTP status codes 200 and 304 are both successful responses, but they indicate different things:

1. **200 OK**: This is the standard response for successful HTTP requests. When you see this status code, it means the request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.

2. **304 Not Modified**: This is used for caching purposes. It is telling to client that the requested document has not been modified since the last request. When the server returns this response, it's not sending the data again, saving bandwidth. This typically happens when the server has been configured to set ETag headers and the client (your browser) is set to cache resources.

Both of these status codes indicate that the requests were successful, so they shouldn't be causing your pages to render blank. If you're seeing these status codes for your API calls to Supabase, it means the API calls are working correctly. The issue might be somewhere else in your code.

GitHub Copilot: Based on the information provided, it seems like the HTTP requests to your server are working correctly. Both the 200 and 304 status codes indicate successful requests. The 200 status code means the request was successful and the server returned the requested data. The 304 status code means the requested resource has not been modified since the last request and the server is not returning the data again, saving bandwidth.

The issue might be somewhere else in your code. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your routing**: Make sure the route for the signup page is correctly defined in your `public.jsx` file and that it correctly points to the `signup.jsx` file.

2. **Check your `signup.jsx` file**: Make sure there are no errors in this file that could be causing the page to render blank. This could be anything from syntax errors to issues with the state or props.

3. **Check your server logs**: If there's an issue with your server, it might be logging errors that can help you diagnose the problem.

4. **Check your browser console**: If there's an issue with your JavaScript, your browser console might be logging errors that can help you diagnose the problem.

5. **Check network tab in browser dev tools**: If there's an issue with the loading of resources (like CSS or JavaScript files), you might be able to see it in the network tab of your browser's developer tools.

Remember, debugging is a process of elimination. By checking these things, you can hopefully narrow down where the problem might be.

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for providing the `signup.jsx` file. The code seems to be well-structured and follows good practices. Here's a brief overview of what it does:

1. It imports necessary dependencies and styles.
2. It defines a `Signup` functional component which uses several pieces of state to manage form inputs and validation states.
3. It defines helper functions `isValidEmail` and `isPasswordValid` to validate the email and password respectively.
4. It uses the `useCallback` hook to create memoized versions of the `validateEmail` and `handleEmailChange` functions.
5. It uses the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects such as validating the email whenever it changes, checking if the password and re-entered password match, and handling the signup process.
6. It defines a `handleSubmit` function which is called when the signup form is submitted. This function checks if all required fields are filled and valid, and then initiates the signup process.
7. It returns a JSX structure which represents the signup form. This includes input fields for first name, last name, email, password, and re-entered password, a submit button, and a toast notification for displaying messages.

If you're having issues with this file, please provide more details about the problem so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: signup page is the issue which is continuing

GitHub Copilot: Based on the provided `signup.jsx` file, the code seems to be well-structured and follows good practices. However, if you're experiencing issues with the signup page, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the `useAuth` hook**: The `useAuth` hook is used to handle the signup process. Make sure this hook is working correctly and returning the expected values.

2. **Check the `signup` function**: This function is called when the signup form is submitted. Make sure this function is correctly implemented in your `useAuth` hook and it's correctly handling the signup process.

3. **Check the `navigate` function**: This function is used to redirect the user to the login page after successful signup. Make sure the `/Login` route is correctly defined in your routing configuration.

4. **Check the `Toast` component**: This component is used to display messages. Make sure this component is correctly implemented and it's correctly displaying the messages.

5. **Check the form validation**: The form validation is done using several pieces of state (`invalidEmail`, `passwordMatching`, etc.) and helper functions (`isValidEmail`, `isPasswordValid`, etc.). Make sure these states and functions are correctly working and updating the form validation status.

6. **Check the form inputs**: Make sure the form inputs are correctly updating their corresponding states when their values change.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide more details about the problem (e.g., any error messages, unexpected behavior, etc.) so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: Here is the required toast.jsx

GitHub Copilot: The `toast.jsx` file you've provided is a React component that uses the Syncfusion library to display toast notifications. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

1. It imports necessary dependencies, including styles and components from the Syncfusion library, and PropTypes for type checking.

2. It defines a `TOAST_TYPES` object that maps toast types to their corresponding CSS classes.

3. It defines a `Toast` functional component that takes `errorMessage`, `type`, and `onClose` as props.

4. Inside the `Toast` component, it defines a `toastInstance` variable to hold a reference to the `ToastComponent` instance, and a `position` object to specify the position of the toast.

5. It defines `toastCreated` and `toastDestroyed` functions that are called when the toast is created and destroyed, respectively. The `toastCreated` function shows the toast, and the `toastDestroyed` function sets `clickToClose` to `true` and calls the `onClose` prop if it's provided.

6. It returns a JSX structure that renders a `ToastComponent` with the provided props and the defined functions as event handlers.

7. It defines PropTypes for the `Toast` component to enforce the types of its props.

8. It exports the `Toast` component as the default export of the module.

If you're having issues with this file, please provide more details about the problem so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: Shared toast.jsx as requested by you to fix signup blank rendering issue

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for sharing the `toast.jsx` file. This component seems to be correctly implemented and should work as expected. However, if the signup page is not rendering correctly, the issue might not be with the `Toast` component itself but how it's being used in the `signup.jsx` file.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the `Toast` component usage in `signup.jsx`**: Make sure you're correctly importing and using the `Toast` component in the `signup.jsx` file. The `Toast` component should be rendered conditionally based on whether there's an error message to display or not.

2. **Check the `errorMessage` prop**: Make sure you're passing a string as the `errorMessage` prop when using the `Toast` component in the `signup.jsx` file. If you're passing an object or any other non-string value, it might cause issues.

3. **Check the `type` prop**: Make sure you're passing a string that matches one of the keys in the `TOAST_TYPES` object as the `type` prop when using the `Toast` component in the `signup.jsx` file. If you're passing a string that doesn't match any of the keys, the `Toast` component will default to the 'info' type.

4. **Check the `onClose` prop**: Make sure you're passing a function as the `onClose` prop when using the `Toast` component in the `signup.jsx` file. This function will be called when the toast is clicked to close.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide more details about the problem (e.g., any error messages, unexpected behavior, etc.) so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: Possible to test some logs here to check why Register rendering blank?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can add `console.log` statements in your code to debug the issue. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
// Add a log statement in the beginning of the Signup component to check if it's being rendered
const Signup = () => {
  console.log('Signup component is being rendered');

  // Rest of the code...
};

// Add a log statement in the useEffect hook that handles signup to check if it's being called
useEffect(() => {
  console.log('Signup useEffect is being called', signupData);
  // Rest of the code...
}, [signupData, navigate]);

// Add a log statement in the handleSubmit function to check if it's being called
const handleSubmit = () => {
  console.log('handleSubmit is being called');
  // Rest of the code...
};

// Add a log statement in the render method to check if the Toast component is being rendered
return (
  <div className="control-pane">
    {/* Rest of the code... */}
    {toast.show && (
      <Toast
        errorMessage={toast.message}
        type={toast.type}
        onClose={() => {
          console.log('Toast onClose is being called');
          setToast({
            show: false,
            message: '',
            type: 'error',
          });
        }}
      />
    )}
    {/* Rest of the code... */}
  </div>
);
```

After adding these log statements, open the browser's developer tools (press F12), go to the Console tab, and check the logs when you try to render the Signup page. This should give you some clues about what's going wrong.

harihargithub: Nothing logged 

GitHub Copilot: If nothing is being logged, it means that the `Signup` component is not being rendered at all. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the routing**: Make sure that the route that should render the `Signup` component is correctly defined in your router configuration. The path in the route should match the URL you're trying to access, and the `Signup` component should be specified as the component to render for that route.

2. **Check the import statement**: Make sure that you're correctly importing the `Signup` component in the file where you define your routes. The path in the import statement should correctly point to the `signup.jsx` file.

3. **Check for errors in other components**: If there's an error in another component that's being rendered before the `Signup` component, it might prevent the `Signup` component from being rendered. Check the console for any error messages that might indicate an issue with another component.

4. **Check if the `Signup` component is conditionally rendered**: If the `Signup` component is conditionally rendered based on some state or prop, make sure that the condition is being met. If the condition is not being met, the `Signup` component will not be rendered.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide more details about your router configuration and how you're trying to render the `Signup` component so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: AppRourtes.jsx is under src and Register ie. signup.jsx is under src/pages

GitHub Copilot: Thank you for sharing the `AppRoutes.jsx` file. The routing configuration seems to be correct. You have two routes that render the `Signup` component: `/Register` and `/signup`. 

If you're trying to access the signup page by navigating to `/Register` or `/signup` in your application and it's not rendering, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the `Signup` component import**: Make sure that the `Signup` component is correctly imported from the `./pages/signup` path. If the `signup.jsx` file is not located at this path relative to the `AppRoutes.jsx` file, it might cause issues.

2. **Check for case sensitivity**: URLs are case-sensitive. Make sure you're using the correct case when trying to access the routes. For example, `/Register` is not the same as `/register`.

3. **Check the `PublicRoutes` component**: The routes that render the `Signup` component are nested inside the `PublicRoutes` component. If there's an issue with this component, it might prevent the nested routes from being rendered. Make sure the `PublicRoutes` component is correctly implemented and it's rendering its children.

4. **Check for conflicts with other routes**: If there's another route that matches the URL you're trying to access before the routes that render the `Signup` component, it might prevent these routes from being matched. Make sure there's no such conflict.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide more details about the problem (e.g., any error messages, unexpected behavior, etc.) so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: All seems proper but nothing logged

GitHub Copilot: If the `console.log` statements in the `Signup` component are not being logged, it means that the component is not being rendered. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Routing issue**: The `Signup` component is not being rendered because the route that should render it is not being matched. Make sure that you're navigating to the correct URL that matches the route for the `Signup` component.

2. **Error in a higher-level component**: If there's an error in a higher-level component (a component that renders the `Signup` component), it could prevent the `Signup` component from being rendered. Check the console for any error messages that might indicate an issue with a higher-level component.

3. **Error in the `Signup` component**: If there's an error in the `Signup` component itself, it could prevent the component from being rendered. However, this seems unlikely in your case because an error in the `Signup` component would usually result in an error message being logged to the console.

4. **The `Signup` component is not being imported correctly**: If the `Signup` component is not being imported correctly in the file where you define your routes, it could prevent the component from being rendered. Make sure that the path in the import statement correctly points to the `signup.jsx` file.

To debug this issue, you could add a `console.log` statement in the `AppRoutes.jsx` file right before the routes that render the `Signup` component to check if these routes are being rendered. For example:

```jsx
console.log('Rendering routes');
return (
  <Routes>
    <PublicRoutes path="/">
      <Route path="/Login" element={<Login />} />
      <Route path="/Register" element={<Signup />} />
      <Route path="/signup" element={<Signup />} />
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
    </PublicRoutes>
    <PrivateRoutes path="/app">
      <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
      <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
      <Route path="/settings" element={<Settings />} />
      <Route path="/logout" element={<Logout />} />
      <Route path="/" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </PrivateRoutes>
  </Routes>
);
```

If the `console.log` statement is being logged, it means that the routes are being rendered and the issue is likely with the `Signup` component or the route that should render it. If the `console.log` statement is not being logged, it means that the routes are not being rendered and the issue is likely with a higher-level component.

GitHub Copilot: The HTML you've shared is the basic structure of your application's HTML file. It's the file that gets loaded when you start your application, and it's where your React application gets mounted (in the div with the id "root").

However, this HTML file doesn't provide any specific information about why the `Register` page is rendering blank. The issue is likely in your JavaScript code, not in this HTML file.

The JavaScript code for your application is being loaded from the `/src/main.jsx` file, as indicated by the script tag at the end of the body. This is where your React application starts, and it's likely where your `BrowserRouter` and `Routes` are defined.

If the `Register` page is rendering blank, it means that the `Signup` component is not being rendered when you navigate to the `/Register` route. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The `/Register` route is not being matched. Make sure that you're navigating to the correct URL and that the `/Register` route is correctly defined in your `Routes` component.

2. The `Signup` component is not being imported correctly in the file where you define your routes. Make sure that the path in the import statement correctly points to the `signup.jsx` file.

3. There's an error in the `Signup` component that's preventing it from being rendered. Check the console for any error messages that might indicate an issue with the `Signup` component.

4. There's an error in a higher-level component (a component that renders the `Signup` component) that's preventing the `Signup` component from being rendered. Check the console for any error messages that might indicate an issue with a higher-level component.

If you're still experiencing issues, please provide more details about your `main.jsx` file and how you're trying to render the `Signup` component so I can assist you better.

GitHub Copilot: Based on the code you've provided, it seems like you're using Supabase for authentication and Zustand for state management. The issue with the Register & Login pages not rendering could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. Ensure that the `supabase` client is correctly initialized with the correct URL and ANON KEY. You have hardcoded these values in `hooks/supabase.jsx`, but you're also trying to import them from environment variables in `src/supaStore.jsx`. Make sure these values are correct and consistent.

2. Check the components where `useAuth` and `useAuthStore` hooks are used. Ensure that the state and functions returned by these hooks are correctly used.

3. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools. If there are any failed network requests, they could be the reason why your pages are not rendering.

4. Check the console in your browser's developer tools for any JavaScript errors. If there are any, they could be preventing your pages from rendering.

5. Ensure that the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_KEY` environment variables are correctly set in your `.env` file and that they are being correctly imported in your `src/supaStore.jsx` file.

6. Check if the `supabase.auth.signIn` and `supabase.auth.signUp` functions are correctly implemented and are returning the expected results.

Without more specific information about the error or the way you're using these hooks in your components, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.

harihargithub: The issue is signup page is not rendering and no logs too

GitHub Copilot: The issue could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. Ensure that the `useAuth` hook is correctly implemented and exported. If there's an error in this hook, it could prevent the `Signup` component from rendering.

2. Check if the `Signup` component is correctly imported and used in the parent component. If it's not, it won't be rendered.

3. Check if the route to the `Signup` component is correctly set up. If it's not, navigating to the signup page won't render the `Signup` component.

4. Check the console in your browser's developer tools for any JavaScript errors. If there are any, they could be preventing your page from rendering.

5. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools. If there are any failed network requests, they could be the reason why your page is not rendering.

6. Ensure that all the dependencies of the `Signup` component are correctly installed and imported. If any dependency is missing or incorrectly imported, it could prevent the component from rendering.

Without more specific information about the error or the way you're using the `Signup` component, it's difficult to provide a more specific solution.

harihargithub: 'children' is missing in props validationeslintreact/prop-types
(parameter) children: any

GitHub Copilot: The warning you're seeing is from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes. 

In your case, the `children` prop is not validated. You can fix this by adding `children` to your component's propTypes. 

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// ... rest of your code

Wrapper.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,
};

export default Wrapper;
```

In this code, `PropTypes.node` is used to validate `children`. This is because `children` can be any renderable React child, such as a string, a number, a React element, or an array of these things. The `isRequired` makes sure that the `children` prop is always provided.

harihargithub: Syncfusion Licence# keep changing, is it?

GitHub Copilot: Syncfusion's license key does not change on its own. Once you have obtained a license key from Syncfusion, you can use it for the specified period of the license. 

However, there are a few scenarios where you might need to update your Syncfusion license key:

1. **License Renewal or Upgrade:** If you renew or upgrade your Syncfusion license, you will receive a new license key.

2. **Switching Between License Types:** If you switch from a trial license to a paid license, or between different types of paid licenses (for example, from a single developer license to a global license), you will receive a new license key.

3. **License Expiration:** If your license expires, you will need to renew your license and update your license key to continue using Syncfusion products.

Remember to replace the old license key with the new one in your project after any changes. If you're facing issues with your Syncfusion license key changing unexpectedly, it's best to contact Syncfusion support for assistance.

GitHub Copilot: To make the Logout button in `Wrapper.jsx` redirect to the `/logout` route, you can use the `useHistory` hook from `react-router-dom` to programmatically navigate to the `/logout` route when the Logout button is clicked.

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
// ... other imports

const Wrapper = ({ children }) => {
  const history = useHistory();

  const handleLogout = () => {
    history.push("/logout");
  };

  return (
    // ... other code
    <ButtonComponent
      cssClass="e-danger e-block"
      onClick={handleLogout}
      style={{ fontSize: "1.2em" }}
    >
      Logout
    </ButtonComponent>
    // ... other code
  );
};

// ... rest of your code
```

In this code, `useHistory` is a hook that gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate. The `handleLogout` function uses the `push` method on the history instance to navigate to the `/logout` route. This function is then passed to the `onClick` prop of the `ButtonComponent`.

harihargithub: ncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/node_modules/.vite/deps/react-router-dom.js?v=a0e5b1d8' does not provide an export named 'useHistory' (at Wrapper.jsx:11:10)

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `useHistory` hook is not exported from `react-router-dom`. This is likely because you're using version 6 of `react-router-dom`, which has replaced the `useHistory` hook with the `useNavigate` hook.

Here's how you can update your code to use the `useNavigate` hook:

```jsx
import { useNavigate } from "react-router-dom";

// ... other imports

const Wrapper = ({ children }) => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleLogout = () => {
    navigate("/logout");
  };

  return (
    // ... other code
    <ButtonComponent
      cssClass="e-danger e-block"
      onClick={handleLogout}
      style={{ fontSize: "1.2em" }}
    >
      Logout
    </ButtonComponent>
    // ... other code
  );
};

// ... rest of your code
```

In this code, `useNavigate` is a hook that gives you access to the navigate function that you may use to navigate. The `handleLogout` function uses the navigate function to navigate to the `/logout` route. This function is then passed to the `onClick` prop of the `ButtonComponent`.

harihargithub: Next here’s the code for our Modal.js component and where to include it? -
import "@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-popups/styles/material.css";
import { DialogComponent } from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-popups";

const Modal = ({ showModal, handleClose, children }) => {
  const dialogClose = () => {
	handleClose();
  };

  return (
	<div className="modal" id="dialog-target">
  	 <DialogComponent
    	   width="95%"
    	   close={dialogClose}
    	   header="Fill the product details"
    	   target={"#main-area"}
    	   visible={!!showModal}
    	   showCloseIcon={true}
    	   position={{ X: "center", Y: "center" }}
  	 >
    	  {children}
  	 </DialogComponent>
	</div>
  );
};
export default Modal;

GitHub Copilot: The `Modal` component you've created can be included in any component where you need a modal dialog. 

For example, if you want to use this modal in your `ManageProducts` page, you can import and use it like this:

```jsx
import Modal from './Modal'; // adjust the path based on where your Modal.js file is located

// ... other code

const ManageProducts = () => {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  const handleOpenModal = () => {
    setShowModal(true);
  };

  const handleCloseModal = () => {
    setShowModal(false);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleOpenModal}>Open Modal</button>
      <Modal showModal={showModal} handleClose={handleCloseModal}>
        {/* You can put any content you want in the modal here */}
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      </Modal>
      {/* ... other code */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ManageProducts;
```

In this code, `useState` is used to create a state variable `showModal` that determines whether the modal is shown. The `handleOpenModal` and `handleCloseModal` functions are used to open and close the modal, respectively. The `Modal` component is used with these functions passed as props, and any content you want in the modal is put as children of the `Modal` component.

harihargithub: Modal.jsx location pelase

GitHub Copilot: Based on the provided project structure, the `Modal.jsx` file is not present. However, a typical place to put a `Modal.jsx` component would be in the `components` directory. 

So, you would create and save your `Modal.jsx` file in the following location:

```plaintext
┣ 📂src
┃ ┣ 📂components
┃ ┃ ┣ 📜navbar.jsx
┃ ┃ ┣ 📜toast.jsx
┃ ┃ ┣ 📜Wrapper.jsx
┃ ┃ ┗ 📜Modal.jsx  // Here is your Modal.jsx
```

After creating the `Modal.jsx` file in the `components` directory, you can import it in other components like this:

```jsx
import Modal from './components/Modal';
```

Please adjust the import path according to where you use it.

harihargithub: Line#6 has missing props error

GitHub Copilot: The error you're seeing is likely from the ESLint plugin `react/prop-types`. This rule enforces that all props used in a component are validated in the component's propTypes. 

In your case, the `showModal`, `handleClose`, and `children` props are not validated. You can fix this by adding these props to your component's propTypes. 

Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// ... rest of your code

Modal.propTypes = {
  showModal: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  handleClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.node,
};

export default Modal;
```

In this code, `PropTypes.bool` is used to validate `showModal`, `PropTypes.func` is used to validate `handleClose`, and `PropTypes.node` is used to validate `children`. The `isRequired` makes sure that the `showModal` and `handleClose` props are always provided. The `children` prop is optional.

harihargithub: Line#14 - Mixed spaces and tabs.eslintno-mixed-spaces-and-tabs

GitHub Copilot: The error message you're seeing is from the ESLint rule `no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs`. This rule disallows mixed spaces and tabs for indentation. 

In your code, it seems like you're using both spaces and tabs for indentation. To fix this, you should choose one type of indentation (either spaces or tabs) and stick with it.

Here's how your code would look if you choose to use spaces for indentation:

```jsx
import "@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-popups/styles/material.css";
import { DialogComponent } from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-popups";
import PropTypes from "prop-types";

const Modal = ({ showModal, handleClose, children }) => {
  const dialogClose = () => {
    handleClose();
  };

  return (
    <div className="modal" id="dialog-target">
      <DialogComponent
        width="95%"
        close={dialogClose}
        header="Fill the product details"
        target={"#main-area"}
        visible={!!showModal}
        showCloseIcon={true}
        position={{ X: "center", Y: "center" }}
      >
        {children}
      </DialogComponent>
    </div>
  );
};

Modal.propTypes = {
  showModal: PropTypes.bool.isRequired,
  handleClose: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  children: PropTypes.node,
};

export default Modal;
```

In this code, all indentation is done with spaces. If you prefer to use tabs for indentation, you would replace all spaces used for indentation with tabs.

harihargithub: Updated code for ManageProducts.jsx is as follows: 
import { useState } from "react";
import Wrapper from '../components/Wrapper';
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css";
import { ButtonComponent } from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons";
import "./manageProduct.css";
import Modal from "../components/Modal";
import ProductAdd from "./productAdd";

const ManageProducts = () => {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  return (
	<Wrapper>
  	 <div className="manage-products">
    	  <div className="add-product">
      	   <ButtonComponent
        	cssClass="e-info"
        	onClick={() => {
          	setShowModal(true);
        	}}
        	style={{ fontSize: "1.2em" }}
      	   >
        	Add new product
      	   </ButtonComponent>
    	  </div>
    	  <Modal
      	     showModal={showModal}
      	     handleClose={() => {
        	setShowModal(false);
      	     }}
    	  >
      	    <ProductAdd />
    	  </Modal>
  	</div>
      </Wrapper>
  );
};

export default ManageProducts;

GitHub Copilot: The updated `ManageProducts.jsx` file looks correct. It imports and uses the `Modal` component correctly. When the "Add new product" button is clicked, it sets `showModal` to `true`, which causes the `Modal` to be displayed. The `Modal` contains the `ProductAdd` component. When the modal is closed, it sets `showModal` to `false`, which hides the `Modal`.

If you're facing any issues or have any questions about this code, feel free to ask!

harihargithub: Indenation issue from line#15

GitHub Copilot: The indentation issue you're seeing is likely due to a mix of tabs and spaces, or inconsistent use of indentation levels. Here's the corrected code with consistent 2-space indentation:

```jsx
// ManageProducts.jsx under src/pages folder
import { useState } from "react";
import Wrapper from '../components/Wrapper';
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css";
import { ButtonComponent } from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons";
import "./manageProduct.css";
import Modal from "../components/Modal";
import ProductAdd from "./productAdd";

const ManageProducts = () => {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  return (
    <Wrapper>
      <div className="manage-products">
        <div className="add-product">
          <ButtonComponent
            cssClass="e-info"
            onClick={() => {
              setShowModal(true);
            }}
            style={{ fontSize: "1.2em" }}
          >
            Add new product
          </ButtonComponent>
        </div>
        <Modal
          showModal={showModal}
          handleClose={() => {
            setShowModal(false);
          }}
        >
          <ProductAdd />
        </Modal>
      </div>
    </Wrapper>
  );
};

export default ManageProducts;
```

In this code, each indentation level is consistently 2 spaces. This makes the code easier to read and understand.

harihargithub: Next productAdd.jsx and advise it's location please

GitHub Copilot: The `productAdd.jsx` file should be located in the same directory as your `ManageProducts.jsx` file since it's imported with a relative path from the same directory. 

Here's the directory structure:

```plaintext
┣ 📂src
┃ ┣ 📂pages
┃ ┃ ┣ 📜ManageProducts.jsx
┃ ┃ ┗ 📜productAdd.jsx  // Here is your productAdd.jsx
```

The `productAdd.jsx` file should contain a React component that represents the form or interface for adding a product. Here's a basic example of what it might look like:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ProductAdd = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      <label>
        Product Name:
        <input type="text" name="name" />
      </label>
      <label>
        Product Price:
        <input type="text" name="price" />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
}

export default ProductAdd;
```

This is a very basic form with fields for the product name and price. You would likely want to add more fields and functionality based on your specific needs.

harihargithub: Kindly fix mixed tabs & spaces issue here please

harihargithub: [plugin:vite:import-analysis] Failed to resolve import "../components/TextEditor" from "src/pages/productAdd.jsx".

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `TextEditor` component cannot be found at the specified path. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The `TextEditor` component does not exist at the specified path.
2. There is a typo in the file name or path.
3. The file exists but is not correctly exported.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `TextEditor` component exists at the specified path (`../components/TextEditor`), and it is correctly exported.

Here's an example of how the `TextEditor` component might be exported:

```jsx
// TextEditor.jsx
import React from 'react';

const TextEditor = () => {
  // Your component logic here
};

export default TextEditor;
```

And the directory structure should look like this:

```plaintext
┣ 📂src
┃ ┣ 📂pages
┃ ┃ ┗ 📜productAdd.jsx
┃ ┣ 📂components
┃ ┃ ┗ 📜TextEditor.jsx
```

If the `TextEditor` component is in a different directory, you need to adjust the import statement in `productAdd.jsx` accordingly.

harihargithub: 5:46:39 pm [vite] Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor/styles/material.css" from "src/components/TextEditor.jsx". Does the file exist?

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the file `@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor/styles/material.css` cannot be found. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The `@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor` package is not installed. You can install it using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install @syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor
   # or
   yarn add @syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor
   ```

2. The `material.css` file does not exist in the `styles` directory of the `@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor` package. This could be due to a version mismatch or the file might have been moved in a recent update.

3. There is a typo in the file name or path.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor` package is installed and the `material.css` file exists in the `styles` directory. If the file does not exist, you might need to check the documentation of the `@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor` package to find the correct path.

harihargithub: Line#23 Fast refresh only works when a file only exports components. Move your component(s) to a separate file.eslint(react-refresh/only-export-components)
const TextEditor: (props: any, ref: any) => React.JSX.Element

GitHub Copilot: The error message is from the ESLint plugin `react-refresh/only-export-components`, which enforces that a file only exports React components to ensure compatibility with React Fast Refresh.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that your file only exports React components. If you have other exports (like constants, helper functions, etc.), you should move them to a separate file.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
// TextEditor.jsx
import "@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-icons/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-buttons/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-splitbuttons/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-inputs/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-lists/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-navigations/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-popups/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor/styles/material.css";

import {
  HtmlEditor,
  Image,
  Inject,
  Link,
  QuickToolbar,
  RichTextEditorComponent,
  Toolbar,
} from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-richtexteditor";

import { forwardRef } from "react";

const TextEditor = (props, ref) => {
  // Your component logic here
};

export default forwardRef(TextEditor);
```

If you have other exports in this file, move them to a separate file. For example, if you have a helper function:

```jsx
// helper.js
export const helperFunction = () => {
  // Your helper function logic here
};
```

Then, import the helper function in the file where you need it:

```jsx
// AnotherFile.jsx
import { helperFunction } from './helper';
```

This way, your `TextEditor.jsx` file only exports a React component, which should resolve the ESLint error.

harihargithub: npm install @syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor done but still [vite] Internal server error: Failed to resolve import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-richtexteditor" from "src/components/TextEditor.jsx". Does the file exist?
  Plugin: vite:import-analysi

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `@syncfusion/ej2-react-richtexteditor` package cannot be found. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The `@syncfusion/ej2-react-richtexteditor` package is not installed. You can install it using npm or yarn:

   ```bash

2. There is a typo in the package name.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the `@syncfusion/ej2-react-richtexteditor` package is installed. If the package is installed and you still see this error, you might need to restart your development server or even your IDE, as sometimes the changes are not picked up immediately.

harihargithub: Uncaught TypeError: supabase is not a function
    at ProductAdd (productAdd.jsx:24:20)

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that `supabase` is not a function. This means that the way you're trying to use `supabase` in your `ProductAdd` component is incorrect.

Based on your import statement `import { supabase } from "../../hooks/supabase";`, it seems like `supabase` is an exported member from the `supabase` module, not a function.

If `supabase` is an instance of the Supabase client, you should use it directly without calling it as a function. 

Replace this line:

```jsx
const SupaBase = supabase();
```

with:

```jsx
const SupaBase = supabase;
```

If `supabase` is indeed a function that returns an instance of the Supabase client, you need to ensure that it's exported correctly from the `supabase` module. The file might look something like this:

```jsx
// supabase.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

export const supabase = () => {
  const supabaseUrl = 'your-supabase-url'
  const supabaseKey = 'your-supabase-key'
  return createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey)
}
```

If this is not the case, please check the `supabase` module to ensure it exports what you expect.

harihargithub: Please assist with -
We’ve set up the initiation flow for adding a product. Let’s create the component to manage the product addition functionality. This component will encompass everything, from the input components to the API call required to create a new product.

The component will include four input fields and a rich text editor for the product description:

Name of the product (input field)
Price of the product (input field)
Image URL of the product (input field)
After purchase redirect URL (input field)
Description of the product (rich text editor)
We won’t store any images in SupaBase. Instead, we will request the URLs of the images after the product’s sale. For example, after purchasing an ebook, the customer will be redirected to a Google Drive link that contains the downloadable PDF.

The data recorded by these input fields will be stored in the SupaBase database. As such, our first step will be to create a products table in the database. This table will store all the information related to the products.

create table
  public.products (
	id bigint generated by default as identity,
	created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
	product_details text null,
	product_name character varying null,
	product_price character varying null,
	product_thumbnail text null,
	user_details json null,
	product_offering text null,
	user_id character varying null,
	constraint products_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
To create a new table, you can execute the appropriate query. This table will serve as a reference to the product, linked via the User ID. This linkage allows us to identify the users along with the products they have created, enabling us to display the relevant products on their dashboard.

GitHub Copilot: It seems like you have already set up the `ProductAdd` component correctly. It includes all the necessary input fields and the rich text editor for the product description. The `handleClick` function is responsible for making the API call to Supabase to create a new product.

The SQL command you provided will create a new table named `products` in your Supabase database. This table includes all the necessary fields to store the product information.

To execute this SQL command, you need to:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard.
2. Navigate to the SQL editor.
3. Paste the SQL command into the editor.
4. Click the "Run" button to execute the command.

After the table is created, the `ProductAdd` component will be able to store product information in the `products` table. The `user_id` field in the `products` table links each product to a user, which allows you to display the relevant products on each user's dashboard.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions, please provide more specific details so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: Please advise on 3. SQL command

GitHub Copilot: The SQL command you provided is used to create a new table in your database. This table, named `products`, will store all the information related to the products. Here's a breakdown of the command:

```sql
create table
  public.products (
	id bigint generated by default as identity,
	created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
	product_details text null,
	product_name character varying null,
	product_price character varying null,
	product_thumbnail text null,
	user_details json null,
	product_offering text null,
	user_id character varying null,
	constraint products_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;
```

This command creates a new table in the `public` schema named `products` with the following columns:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each product. It's a `bigint` type and is automatically generated as an identity column, meaning it will auto-increment with each new row.
- `created_at`: A timestamp indicating when the product was created. It's set to the current time by default.
- `product_details`: A text column to store the details of the product.
- `product_name`: A variable character column to store the name of the product.
- `product_price`: A variable character column to store the price of the product.
- `product_thumbnail`: A text column to store the URL of the product's thumbnail image.
- `user_details`: A JSON column to store the details of the user who created the product.
- `product_offering`: A text column to store the URL where the product can be purchased.
- `user_id`: A variable character column to store the ID of the user who created the product.

The `constraint products_pkey primary key (id)` line sets the `id` column as the primary key of the table, ensuring that each product has a unique ID.

The `tablespace pg_default` line specifies that the table should be created in the default tablespace. In PostgreSQL, a tablespace is a location on disk where data files are stored.

To execute this command, you would typically use a SQL client to connect to your database, paste the command into the query editor, and run the command. If you're using Supabase, you can run this command in the Supabase SQL editor.

harihargithub: Shall I add it @ https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uyqzpgmjgigdwiygoagg/sql/new  -
create table
  public.products (
    id bigint generated by default as identity,
    created_at timestamp with time zone not null default now(),
    product_details text null,
    product_name character varying null,
    product_price character varying null,
    product_thumbnail text null,
    user_details json null,
    product_offering text null,
    user_id character varying null,
    constraint products_pkey primary key (id)
  ) tablespace pg_default;

GitHub Copilot: Yes, you can add this SQL command in the Supabase SQL editor to create the `products` table. Here are the steps:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard.
2. Navigate to your project.
3. Click on the "SQL" tab in the left sidebar.
4. Click on the "+ New Query" button.
5. Paste your SQL command into the editor.
6. Click the "Run" button to execute the command.

This will create a new table named `products` in your Supabase database with the specified columns. The `user_id` field in the `products` table links each product to a user, which allows you to display the relevant products on each user's dashboard.

harihargithub: SQL Editor -> Create New Table, right?

GitHub Copilot: No, to create a new table using the SQL command you provided, you should use the SQL Editor, not the "Create New Table" GUI. Here are the steps:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard.
2. Navigate to your project.
3. Click on the "SQL" tab in the left sidebar.
4. Click on the "+ New Query" button.
5. Paste your SQL command into the editor.
6. Click the "Run" button to execute the command.

This will create a new table named `products` in your Supabase database with the specified columns. The `user_id` field in the `products` table links each product to a user, which allows you to display the relevant products on each user's dashboard.

harihargithub: Can't find run button

GitHub Copilot: In the Supabase SQL editor, the "Run" button is typically located at the top right corner of the editor. If you can't find it, make sure you're in the correct section of the Supabase dashboard:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard.
2. Navigate to your project.
3. Click on the "SQL" tab in the left sidebar.
4. Click on the "+ New Query" button.
5. Paste your SQL command into the editor.

At this point, you should see the "Run" button at the top right corner of the editor. If you still can't find it, you might want to check if your browser is zoomed in too much, causing the button to be off-screen. If that's not the case, try refreshing the page or using a different browser to see if the issue persists.

harihargithub: Please fix indenation & other issues as noticed here 

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's the corrected version of your code with proper indentation and error handling:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import useSupabase from "./supabase";
import productStore from "../store/products";

const useProducts = () => {
  const setProductsList = productStore((state) => state.setProductsList);
  const SupaBase = useSupabase();

  const fetchProducts = async () => {
    try {
      const { data: userData, error: userError } = await SupaBase.auth.getSession();
      if (userError) throw userError;

      const { session } = userData;

      const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
        .from("products")
        .select()
        .eq("user_id", session?.user?.id);

      if (productError) throw productError;

      setProductsList(productData);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error while fetching products list", e);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProducts();
  }, []);

  return {}; // return an object or value if needed
};

export default useProducts;
```

Changes made:

1. Fixed indentation for better readability.
2. Added error handling for `SupaBase.auth.getSession()` and fetching products from the `products` table. If there's an error, it will be thrown and caught in the catch block.
3. Added a return statement in `useProducts` function. React hooks should always return a value, even if it's an empty object.
4. Renamed `useSupbase` to `useSupabase` to match the common spelling of Supabase. Please ensure that the actual import matches this spelling. If your file is indeed named `useSupbase`, disregard this change.

harihargithub: 'useState' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)
'useState' is defined but never used.eslintno-unused-vars

GitHub Copilot: The warnings you're seeing are because you've imported the `useState` hook from React, but you're not using it anywhere in your component. If you don't need to use `useState` in this component, you can simply remove it from the import statement. Here's how your code should look:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { supabase } from "./supabase";
import productStore from "../store/products";

const useProducts = () => {
  const setProductsList = productStore((state) => state.setProductsList);
  const SupaBase = supabase();

  const fetchProducts = async () => {
    try {
      const { data: userData, error: userError } = await SupaBase.auth.getSession();
      if (userError) throw userError;

      const { session } = userData;

      const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
        .from("products")
        .select()
        .eq("user_id", session?.user?.id);

      if (productError) throw productError;

      setProductsList(productData);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error while fetching products list", e);
    }
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProducts();
  }, []);

  return {}; // return an object or value if needed
};

export default useProducts;
```

This should resolve the warnings you're seeing. If you plan to use `useState` later, you can add it back to the import statement when you need it.

harihargithub: Line#31 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fetchProducts'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.eslintreact-hooks/exhaustive-deps

GitHub Copilot: The warning you're seeing is because the `fetchProducts` function is used inside the `useEffect` hook but it's not included in the dependency array. This can lead to unexpected behavior because the `useEffect` hook will not know to re-run if `fetchProducts` changes.

To fix this, you can move the `fetchProducts` function inside the `useEffect` hook. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { supabase } from "./supabase";
import productStore from "../store/products";

const useProducts = () => {
  const setProductsList = productStore((state) => state.setProductsList);
  const SupaBase = supabase();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProducts = async () => {
      try {
        const { data: userData, error: userError } = await SupaBase.auth.getSession();
        if (userError) throw userError;

        const { session } = userData;

        const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
          .from("products")
          .select()
          .eq("user_id", session?.user?.id);

        if (productError) throw productError;

        setProductsList(productData);
      } catch (e) {
        console.error("Error while fetching products list", e);
      }
    };

    fetchProducts();
  }, []); // No dependencies are needed now

  return {}; // return an object or value if needed
};

export default useProducts;
```

Now, the `fetchProducts` function is defined within the `useEffect` hook, so it doesn't need to be included in the dependency array. This should resolve the warning you're seeing.

harihargithub: Line#31 Still throwin missing dependency

GitHub Copilot: The warning you're seeing is because the `useEffect` hook has an empty dependency array, but it includes a function (`fetchProducts`) that uses variables (`setProductsList` and `SupaBase`) from outside its scope. 

To fix this, you can include `setProductsList` and `SupaBase` in the dependency array of the `useEffect` hook. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from "react";
import { supabase } from "./supabase";
import productStore from "../store/products";

const useProducts = () => {
  const setProductsList = productStore((state) => state.setProductsList);
  const SupaBase = supabase();

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchProducts = async () => {
      try {
        const { data: userData, error: userError } = await SupaBase.auth.getSession();
        if (userError) throw userError;

        const { session } = userData;

        const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
          .from("products")
          .select()
          .eq("user_id", session?.user?.id);

        if (productError) throw productError;

        setProductsList(productData);
      } catch (e) {
        console.error("Error while fetching products list", e);
      }
    };

    fetchProducts();
  }, [setProductsList, SupaBase]); // Added dependencies

  return {}; // return an object or value if needed
};

export default useProducts;
```

Now, the `useEffect` hook knows to re-run if `setProductsList` or `SupaBase` changes. This should resolve the warning you're seeing.

 - Need to know the location of DataGrid/index.jsx please

GitHub Copilot: As an AI, I don't have direct access to your file system to provide the exact location of your files. However, based on the information you provided, if the file is named `index.js` and it's located in the `DataGrid` directory, its path relative to the project root would typically be `src/DataGrid/index.js` or `components/DataGrid/index.js`, depending on your project structure.

In general, you can find the location of a file in your project by using the file search feature in your IDE. In Visual Studio Code, you can press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P` on macOS), then start typing the name of the file. The IDE will show a dropdown list of files that match the name as you type.

harihargithub: Sharing the present project stucture so will be approprite to have the DataGrid/index.jsx under src or components?

GitHub Copilot: Based on the project structure you've shared, it would be most appropriate to place the `DataGrid` component under the `components` directory. This is because `DataGrid` is a reusable component and the `components` directory is typically where reusable components are stored in a React project.

So, the location for `DataGrid/index.jsx` would be `src/components/DataGrid/index.jsx`. 

Here's how you can create the `DataGrid` directory and the `index.jsx` file:

1. Navigate to the `components` directory in your project.
2. Create a new directory named `DataGrid`.
3. Inside the `DataGrid` directory, create a new file named `index.jsx`.
4. Paste your `DataGrid` component code into the `index.jsx` file.

This structure will help keep your project organized and make it easier to locate specific components.

Changes made:

1. Removed the unused import `Link` from `react-router-dom`.
2. Added `PropTypes` for props validation.
3. Fixed indentation for better readability.

harihargithub: Line#30-32 missing props validations

GitHub Copilot: You're correct, the props used in the `ThumbnailTemplate` and `DefaultValueTemplate` components are not validated. Here's how you can add `PropTypes` to these components:

```jsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// ...

const DefaultValueTemplate = (props) => {
  return props[props.column.field] || 0;
};

DefaultValueTemplate.propTypes = {
  column: PropTypes.shape({
    field: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  }).isRequired,
};

const ThumbnailTemplate = (props) => {
  return (
    <img
      src={props.product_thumbnail}
      alt={props.product_name}
      title={props.product_name}
      style={{ maxWidth: "50px" }}
    />
  );
};

ThumbnailTemplate.propTypes = {
  product_thumbnail: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  product_name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

// ...
```

This code adds `PropTypes` to the `DefaultValueTemplate` and `ThumbnailTemplate` components, validating that the required props are provided and are of the correct type.

harihargithub: We are passing the ActionTemplates as it triggers state updates to view the modal for editing a product. Thus, we will pass the component rather than passing the state as prop
   - So please advise here accordingly

GitHub Copilot: If you're passing a component via `ActionsTemplate`, you should update the `PropTypes` validation to reflect that. Instead of expecting a function, it should expect an element. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
DataGrid.propTypes = {
  data: PropTypes.array.isRequired,
  ActionsTemplate: PropTypes.element.isRequired,
};
```

This change ensures that `ActionsTemplate` is expected to be a React element (a component), which is what you're passing in. This way, the `ActionsTemplate` can manage its own state and behavior, which is a common pattern in React for encapsulating and reusing behavior.

harihargithub: is it right now?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, your code looks correct now. 

You've imported the necessary styles and components from Syncfusion, defined your `DefaultValueTemplate` and `ThumbnailTemplate` components with appropriate prop types, and created your `DataGrid` component with the correct prop types as well. 

The `DataGrid` component is correctly expecting `data` as an array and `ActionsTemplate` as a React element. 

The `DefaultValueTemplate` and `ThumbnailTemplate` components are also correctly validating their props. 

The `DataGrid` component is correctly setting up the grid with columns and injecting the `Page` service for pagination. 

The unused import `Link` from `react-router-dom` has been removed.

So, everything seems to be in order.

I've fixed the indentation from line 88 onwards. The code should now be easier to read and understand.

harihargithub: Kindly fix indendation and missing dependency here please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I can help with that. Here's the updated code with corrected indentation and missing dependency:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import supabase from "../../hooks/supbase";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-layouts/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css";
import { ButtonComponent } from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons";
import "../productPreview.css"
import useStore from "../store/user";

const ProductPreview = () => {
  const params = useParams();
  const [product, setProduct] = useState({});
  const isLoggedIn = useStore((state) => state.isLoggedIn);
  const SupaBase = supabase();

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, [params.id, fetchProduct]);

  const fetchProduct = async () => {
    try {
      const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
        .from("products")
        .select()
        .eq("id", params.id);

      setProduct(productData.length ? productData[0] : {});
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`There was an error while fetching the product with the id:
        ${params.id}`);
    }
  };

  const isProductFetched = Object.keys(product).length > 0;

  const userMetaData = product?.user_details?.user_metadata;
  const userName = `${userMetaData?.firstName} ${userMetaData?.lastName}`;

  return (
    <div className="product-preview">
      {isProductFetched ? (
        <div>
          <div className="hero-image e-card">
            <img src={product.product_thumbnail} alt={product.product_name} />
          </div>
          <div className="product-details">
            <section className="e-card section-right">
              <h1>
                {product.product_name} | From: {userName}
              </h1>
              <div
                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: product.product_details }}
              ></div>

                </ButtonComponent>
              )}
            </section>
          </div>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <h1>No Product found</h1>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductPreview;
```

Changes made:

1. Fixed indentation for better readability.
2. Added `fetchProduct` to the dependency array of `useEffect` to avoid warning about missing dependency. Please note that `fetchProduct` should be wrapped with `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

harihargithub: The 'fetchProduct' function makes the dependencies of useEffect Hook (at line 18) change on every render. Move it inside the useEffect callback. Alternatively, wrap the definition of 'fetchProduct' in its own useCallback() Hook.eslintreact-hooks/exhaustive-deps
const fetchProduct: () => Promise<void>

GitHub Copilot: You're getting this warning because the `fetchProduct` function is redefined on every render, which causes the `useEffect` hook to run again. To fix this, you can wrap the `fetchProduct` function in a `useCallback` hook, which will ensure that the function is not redefined unless its dependencies change. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState, useCallback } from "react";
// ... other imports

const ProductPreview = () => {
  const params = useParams();
  const [product, setProduct] = useState({});
  const isLoggedIn = useStore((state) => state.isLoggedIn);
  const SupaBase = supabase();

  const fetchProduct = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
        .from("products")
        .select()
        .eq("id", params.id);

      setProduct(productData.length ? productData[0] : {});
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`There was an error while fetching the product with the id:
        ${params.id}`);
    }
  }, [params.id, SupaBase]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, [fetchProduct]);

  // ... rest of the code
};

export default ProductPreview;
```

In this updated code, I've imported `useCallback` from `react` and used it to wrap the `fetchProduct` function. The `useCallback` hook takes two arguments: the function to be memoized and an array of dependencies. The function will only be redefined if any of the dependencies change. In this case, the dependencies are `params.id` and `SupaBase`.

harihargithub: bit confused so kindly provide complete fresh updated code here please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's the updated code:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState, useCallback } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";
import supabase from "../../hooks/supbase";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-layouts/styles/material.css";
import "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons/styles/material.css";
import { ButtonComponent } from "@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons";
import "../productPreview.css"
import useStore from "../store/user";

const ProductPreview = () => {
  const params = useParams();
  const [product, setProduct] = useState({});
  const isLoggedIn = useStore((state) => state.isLoggedIn);
  const SupaBase = supabase();

  const fetchProduct = useCallback(async () => {
    try {
      const { data: productData, error: productError } = await SupaBase
        .from("products")
        .select()
        .eq("id", params.id);

      setProduct(productData.length ? productData[0] : {});
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(`There was an error while fetching the product with the id:
        ${params.id}`);
    }
  }, [params.id, SupaBase]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, [fetchProduct]);

  const isProductFetched = Object.keys(product).length > 0;

  const userMetaData = product?.user_details?.user_metadata;
  const userName = `${userMetaData?.firstName} ${userMetaData?.lastName}`;

  return (
    <div className="product-preview">
      {isProductFetched ? (
        <div>
          <div className="hero-image e-card">
            <img src={product.product_thumbnail} alt={product.product_name} />
          </div>
          <div className="product-details">
            <section className="e-card section-right">
              <h1>
                {product.product_name} | From: {userName}
              </h1>
              <div
                dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: product.product_details }}
              ></div>
            </section>
            <section className="e-card section-left">
              <h2>Price: ${product.product_price}</h2>
              {!isLoggedIn && (
                <ButtonComponent className="e-success">
                  Purchase
                </ButtonComponent>
              )}
            </section>
          </div>
        </div>
      ) : (
        <h1>No Product found</h1>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductPreview;
```

In this updated code, I've moved the `fetchProduct` function above the `useEffect` hook and wrapped it with `useCallback`. This ensures that `fetchProduct` is not redefined on every render, which was causing the `useEffect` hook to run again. The `useEffect` hook now only runs when `fetchProduct` changes, which only happens when its dependencies (`params.id` and `SupaBase`) change.

harihargithub: Kindly fix jsx expression issue here pelase

GitHub Copilot: The issue in your code is that you have an extra closing fragment tag `</>` in your `ActionsTemplate` function. Here's the corrected code:

```jsx
import "./productList.css";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import ProductEdit from "./productEdit";
import Modal from "../components/Modal";
import useProducts from "../../hooks/useProducts";
import productStore from "../store/products";
import DataGrid from "../components/DataGrid/index"

const ProductList = () => {
  const [productToEdit, setProductToEdit] = useState({});
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);
  useProducts();
  const productsList = productStore((state) => state.productsList);

  const ActionsTemplate = (e) => {
    const product = productsList.filter((f) => f.id === e.id)[0] || [];
    return (
      <span>
        <span
          onClick={() => {
            setProductToEdit(e);
            setShowModal(true);
          }}
          className="edit-product"
        >
          Edit
        </span>
        <Link to={`/product/${e.id}`} title={`preview ${e.Name}`}>
          Preview
        </Link>
      </span>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="product-list">
      <DataGrid data={productsList} ActionsTemplate={ActionsTemplate} />
      <Modal
        showModal={showModal}
        handleClose={() => {
          setShowModal(false);
          setProductToEdit({});
        }}
      >
        <ProductEdit product={productToEdit} />
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductList;
```

In this updated code, I've removed the extra closing fragment tag `</>` from the `ActionsTemplate` function. The JSX should now be valid and the code should work as expected.

harihargithub: Line#17 - 'product' is declared but its value is never read.ts(6133)
'product' is assigned a value but never used.eslintno-unused-vars

GitHub Copilot: The `product` variable is indeed declared but not used in your code. If you don't have plans to use it, you can safely remove it. Here's the updated code:

```jsx
import "./productList.css";
import { useState } from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import ProductEdit from "./productEdit";
import Modal from "../components/Modal";
import useProducts from "../../hooks/useProducts";
import productStore from "../store/products";
import DataGrid from "../components/DataGrid/index"

const ProductList = () => {
  const [productToEdit, setProductToEdit] = useState({});
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);
  useProducts();
  const productsList = productStore((state) => state.productsList);

  const ActionsTemplate = (e) => {
    return (
      <span>
        <span
          onClick={() => {
            setProductToEdit(e);
            setShowModal(true);
          }}
          className="edit-product"
        >
          Edit
        </span>
        <Link to={`/product/${e.id}`} title={`preview ${e.Name}`}>
          Preview
        </Link>
      </span>
    );
  };

  return (
    <div className="product-list">
      <DataGrid data={productsList} ActionsTemplate={ActionsTemplate} />
      <Modal
        showModal={showModal}
        handleClose={() => {
          setShowModal(false);
          setProductToEdit({});
        }}
      >
        <ProductEdit product={productToEdit} />
      </Modal>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ProductList;
```

In this updated code, I've removed the `product` variable from the `ActionsTemplate` function since it was not being used.

harihargithub: Need set <Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductPreview />} /> here and just tell me where to include?

GitHub Copilot: You can include the `<Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductPreview />} />` inside the `<Routes>` component where you want the `ProductPreview` component to be rendered when the URL matches `/product/:id`. 

If you want this route to be accessible publicly, you can include it inside the `<Route path="/" element={<PublicRoutes />}>` block. If you want it to be accessible only to authenticated users, you can include it inside the `<Route path="/dashboard" element={<PrivateRoutes />}>` or `<Route path="/app/*" element={<PrivateRoutes />}>` block.

Here's an example of including it in the public routes:

```jsx
import ProductPreview from './pages/ProductPreview'; // import the ProductPreview component at the top

// ...

const AppRoutes = () => {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Navbar />
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<PublicRoutes />}>

        </Route>
        {/* ... rest of the routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
};

export default AppRoutes;
```

In this updated code, I've added the `ProductPreview` route inside the public routes. This means that the `ProductPreview` component will be rendered when the URL matches `/product/:id`, where `:id` is a placeholder for the product ID.

harihargithub: Kindly look here and advise if above route under public is fine?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, placing the route `<Route path="/product/:id" element={<ProductPreview />} />` under public routes is fine if you want the `ProductPreview` page to be accessible to all users, regardless of whether they are logged in or not.

If you want the `ProductPreview` page to be accessible only to authenticated users, you should place this route under private routes.

Remember to import the `ProductPreview` component at the top of your routes file:

```jsx
import ProductPreview from './path_to_your_component/ProductPreview';
```

Replace `'./path_to_your_component/ProductPreview'` with the actual path to your `ProductPreview` component.

harihargithub: Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/hooks/supabase.jsx' does not provide an export named 'default' (at productPreview.jsx:3:8)

GitHub Copilot: The error message suggests that the `supabase.jsx` file does not have a default export, but you're trying to import it as a default export in your `productPreview.jsx` file.

You should either add a default export in your `supabase.jsx` file or change the way you're importing it in your `productPreview.jsx` file.

If `supabase.jsx` exports a function or object named `supabase`, you should import it like this:

```jsx
import { supabase } from "../../hooks/supabase";
```

If you want to keep your import statement as it is in `productPreview.jsx`, you should add a default export in your `supabase.jsx` file:

```jsx
export default supabase;
```

Please replace `supabase` with the actual function or object you're exporting from `supabase.jsx`.

Is Registering of Syncfusion License Key required any where else other than .env & AppRourtes.jsx as License Key valid confirmed by Syncfusion Support Team?


GitHub Copilot: The Syncfusion license key is typically registered in the main entry point of your application. In a React application, this is usually the `index.js` or `index.tsx` file. 

However, it seems like you've registered the license key in your `AppRoutes.jsx` file, which should also work as long as this file is part of the main execution path of your application.

The error message you're seeing suggests that the license key is not being registered correctly. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The `registerLicense` function is not being called before any other Syncfusion components are rendered. Make sure that the `registerLicense` function is one of the first things that gets called in your application.

2. The license key is not being read correctly from the environment variables. Make sure that you're reading the environment variable correctly in your application. In your case, you should be doing something like this:

```jsx
registerLicense(process.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);
```

3. The environment variable is not being set correctly. Make sure that the `.env` file is in the root directory of your project and that it's correctly formatted. The environment variable should not have any spaces around the `=` sign.

4. The license key is not valid. Even though you've mentioned that the Syncfusion support team has confirmed the validity of the license key, it's worth double-checking this. Make sure that the license key is valid for the version of Syncfusion that you're using.

If none of these suggestions work, I would recommend reaching out to the Syncfusion support team again with the specific error message that you're seeing. They might be able to provide more specific guidance based on the error message.

GitHub Copilot: The error message "process is not defined" suggests that the `process` object, which is a global object in Node.js, is not available in the environment where your code is running. This is likely because your code is running in the browser, where the `process` object does not exist.

In Vite, environment variables that start with `VITE_` will be statically replaced during build time. This means that you can use them directly in your code as if they were normal JavaScript variables.

So, instead of using `process.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY`, you can use `import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` directly in your code.

Here's how you can update your code:

```jsx
// Replace this line
// registerLicense(process.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);

// With this line
registerLicense(import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);
```

This should fix the "process is not defined" error. If you're still seeing the Syncfusion license validation message after making this change, please double-check that your `.env` file is correctly formatted and located in the root directory of your project.

harihargithub: registerLicense is given in main.jsx so I have removed it from AppRourtes.jsx - is it right? -
//main.jsx under src folder
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';
import { registerLicense } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

// .env - VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY='Your SF Licence Key'
registerLicense(import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);


GitHub Copilot: Yes, that's correct. 

The `registerLicense` function should be called as early as possible in your application, and the `main.jsx` file is typically the entry point of a React application, so it's a good place to call this function.

By calling `registerLicense` in `main.jsx`, you're ensuring that the license key is registered before any Syncfusion components are rendered, which should prevent the license validation message from appearing.

Just make sure that the `VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` environment variable is correctly set in your `.env` file and that this file is located in the root directory of your project.

harihargithub: Check the syntax here pelase

GitHub Copilot: The syntax of your `.env` file looks correct. 

In a `.env` file, environment variables are defined with the syntax `NAME=VALUE`, and your file follows this syntax. 

However, you should remove the single quotes around the values. While some systems might ignore the single quotes, others might consider them as part of the value, which could cause issues.

Here's how your `.env` file should look:

```properties
VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY=Ngo9BigBOggjHTQxAR8/V1NBaF5cXmZCf1FpRmJGdld5fUVHYVZUTXxaS00DNHVRdkdnWXpdcHZXRGhZV0N3V0Q=

After making this change, your application should be able to read the environment variables correctly.

harihargithub: Ensure that all the referenced Syncfusion assemblies\NuGet packages are all on the same version as license key’s version in your project.  - Please advise here if anything to check?

GitHub Copilot: To ensure that all the referenced Syncfusion assemblies or NuGet packages are on the same version as the license key's version in your project, you need to check the version of the Syncfusion packages in your `package.json` file.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `package.json` file.

2. Look for the `dependencies` section.

3. Check the version of each Syncfusion package. The version is the number after the `:` and inside the quotes. For example, in `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-grids": "^19.3.54"`, the version is `19.3.54`.

4. Make sure that the version of each Syncfusion package matches the version that your license key is for.

If the versions do not match, you might need to update or downgrade the Syncfusion packages to match the version that your license key is for. You can do this by running `npm install @syncfusion/package-name@version-number` in your terminal, replacing `package-name` with the name of the Syncfusion package and `version-number` with the correct version number.

For example, if you need to downgrade the `@syncfusion/ej2-react-grids` package to version `19.3.54`, you would run `npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-grids@19.3.54`.

After making these changes, make sure to test your application thoroughly to ensure that everything still works as expected.

harihargithub: Please check here and advise

GitHub Copilot: As an AI, I don't have the ability to directly view or interact with your files. However, I can provide general advice about the `package-lock.json` file.

The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated for any operations where npm modifies either the `node_modules` tree, or `package.json`. It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

This file is intended to be committed into source repositories, and serves various purposes:

- Describe a single representation of a dependency tree such that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies.
- Provide a facility for users to "time-travel" to previous states of `node_modules` without having to commit the directory itself.
- To facilitate greater visibility of tree changes through readable source control diffs.
- And optimize the installation process by allowing npm to skip repeated metadata resolutions for previously-installed packages.

If you're having a specific issue with your `package-lock.json` file, please provide more details so I can assist you better.

harihargithub: package-loc.json is made active selection to check if all the referenced Syncfusion assemblies\NuGet packages are all on the same version as license key’s version

GitHub Copilot: The `package-lock.json` file in a Node.js project is automatically generated (and should be committed into source control) when dependencies are installed using `npm install`. It describes the exact tree that was generated at the time of installation, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.

This file contains information about your project's dependencies and their respective versions. However, it doesn't directly relate to Syncfusion assemblies or NuGet packages, as those are more commonly associated with .NET projects.

If you're looking to ensure all Syncfusion assemblies or NuGet packages are on the same version as the license key's version, you would typically check this in the `.csproj` file (for .NET Framework) or the `.csproj` or `.fsproj` file (for .NET Core or .NET 5+).

If you're using Syncfusion in a JavaScript project and want to check the versions, you would look in the `package.json` file, not `package-lock.json`. The `package.json` file is where you specify your direct dependencies and their versions. The `package-lock.json` file is automatically generated based on the exact versions installed from `package.json`.

If you need to check the version of a specific package in your `package-lock.json` file, you can do so by searching for the package name in the file and looking at the version number next to it.

harihargithub: package.json made active selection to check syncfusion assemblies are on the same version

GitHub Copilot: From your `package.json` file, it appears that not all Syncfusion packages are on the same version. Here are the versions of your Syncfusion packages:

- `"@syncfusion/ej2-base": "^24.2.7"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-layouts": "^24.2.4"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons": "^24.2.7"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs": "^24.2.7"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations": "^25.2.6"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-notifications": "^24.2.4"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-popups": "^24.2.5"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-react-richtexteditor": "^25.2.6"`
- `"@syncfusion/ej2-richtexteditor": "^25.2.6"`

As you can see, some packages are on version `24.2.x` and others are on version `25.2.x`. 

To ensure all Syncfusion packages are on the same version, you should update the packages to the same version. You can do this by running `npm install @syncfusion/package-name@version-number` in your terminal, replacing `package-name` with the name of the Syncfusion package and `version-number` with the correct version number.

For example, if you want to update all packages to version `25.2.6`, you would run:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-base@25.2.6 @syncfusion/ej2-layouts@25.2.6 @syncfusion/ej2-react-buttons@25.2.6 @syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs@25.2.6 @syncfusion/ej2-react-notifications@25.2.6 @syncfusion/ej2-react-popups@25.2.6
```

After running these commands, all your Syncfusion packages should be on the same version.

GitHub Copilot: The error message `npm ERR! notarget No matching version found for @syncfusion/ej2-layouts@25.2.6.` indicates that there is no version `25.2.6` available for the package `@syncfusion/ej2-layouts`.

You can check the available versions of a package using the `npm show` command. For example, to check the versions of `@syncfusion/ej2-layouts`, you would run:

```bash
npm show @syncfusion/ej2-layouts versions
```

This will output a list of all available versions of the package. You can then choose a version that is available and matches the version of your license key.

If version `25.2.6` is not available for `@syncfusion/ej2-layouts`, you might need to choose a different version for all your Syncfusion packages that matches your license key and is available for all packages.

Once you have determined the correct version, you can update your packages by running `npm install @syncfusion/package-name@version-number` for each package, replacing `package-name` with the name of the Syncfusion package and `version-number` with the correct version number.

GitHub Copilot: The output from `npm show @syncfusion/ej2-layouts versions` shows that version `25.2.6` of `@syncfusion/ej2-layouts` does not exist. The closest versions available are `25.1.37` and `25.2.3`.

You should update your `package.json` file to use a version of `@syncfusion/ej2-layouts` that exists. For example, you could change the version to `25.2.3`:

```json
"@syncfusion/ej2-layouts": "^25.2.3",
```

You should also ensure that all other Syncfusion packages are using a version that exists and is compatible with your license key. For example, if you are using version `25.2.3` of `@syncfusion/ej2-layouts`, you should also use version `25.2.3` of all other Syncfusion packages, if it exists.

After updating your `package.json` file, you can run `npm install` to install the correct versions of the packages.

harihargithub: "@syncfusion/ej2-layouts": "^25.2.3", done and if others packages also needs to be updated kindly provide me the updated package.json file please

GitHub Copilot: Sure, I see that you have multiple Syncfusion packages in your `package.json` file. It's a good practice to keep all packages from the same vendor at the same version to avoid compatibility issues.

Dear Harihar Nagarajan,
Below you will find the license key you requested for the selected platform(s).
Version	:	25.x.x
Platform(s)	:	JavaScript
License Key	:	ORg4AjUWIQA/Gnt2UFhhQlJBfV5AQmBIYVp/TGpJfl96cVxMZVVBJAtUQF1hTX5WdUVhW31ccXFUTmZc

Which one to use?

GitHub Copilot: Both license keys are valid for version `25.x.x`, but they are for different platforms. 

The first license key is for multiple platforms including .NET MAUI, ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET MVC, Blazor, File Formats, JavaScript, UWP, Windows Forms, WinUI, WPF, Xamarin. 

The second license key is exclusively for JavaScript.

Since you are working with JavaScript (as indicated by your `package.json` file), you should use the second license key which is exclusively for JavaScript. 

So, you should keep the following in your `.env` file:

```properties
VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY=ORg4AjUWIQA/Gnt2UFhhQlJBfV5AQmBIYVp/TGpJfl96cVxMZVVBJAtUQF1hTX5WdUVhW31ccXFUTmZc

```

This will ensure that your Syncfusion components are licensed correctly for your JavaScript project.

harihargithub: How to 
ReactJS
Register the license key in the index.js file of the React project.

JS
https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/how-to-register-in-an-application
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { registerLicense } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

// Registering Syncfusion license key
registerLicense('License Key');

So please check and advise as still throwing invalid licence key

GitHub Copilot: Your code seems correct. You are importing the `registerLicense` function from `@syncfusion/ej2-base` and calling it with the license key from your environment variables.

However, please note that environment variables in Vite (the build tool you're using, as indicated by the `VITE_` prefix) are only available on the client-side (in the browser) during development. They are not available in the Node.js environment where your React app is being built.

This means that `import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` will be `undefined` during the build process, which could be why you're seeing an "invalid license key" error.

To fix this, you can use the `dotenv` package to load your environment variables during the build process. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install `dotenv` by running `npm install dotenv`.
2. At the top of your `main.jsx` file, add the following lines:

```jsx
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();
```

3. Replace `import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` with `process.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY`:

```jsx
registerLicense(process.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);
```

Your updated `main.jsx` file should look like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';
import { registerLicense } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

// .env - VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY='Your SF Licence Key'
registerLicense(process.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

After making these changes, try running your app again. The license key should now be correctly registered.

harihargithub: Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined
    at _dotenvKey (dotenv.js?v=d1d92b60:195:7)
    at Object.config (dotenv.js?v=d1d92b60:313:11)
    at main.jsx:9:8

GitHub Copilot: I apologize for the confusion. The `process` object is a global that provides information about, and control over, the current Node.js process. As a global, it is always available to Node.js applications without using `require()`. However, it is not available in the browser/client-side JavaScript.

In a Vite project, you can access environment variables in your JavaScript using `import.meta.env`. Vite has built-in support for loading environment variables from `.env` files in your project root. 

Here's how you can use it:

```jsx
//main.jsx under src folder
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';
import { registerLicense } from '@syncfusion/ej2-base';

// .env - VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY='Your SF Licence Key'
registerLicense(import.meta.env.VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY);

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
);
```

Please ensure that your `.env` file is in the root of your project and that it contains the `VITE_SYNCFUSION_LICENSE_KEY` variable. Also, remember to restart your Vite dev server after making changes to your `.env` file.

No, in your case, `npm install dotenv` is not necessary. 

Vite has built-in support for loading environment variables from `.env` files in your project root. So, you don't need the `dotenv` package. 

You can directly use `import.meta.env.VITE_YOUR_VARIABLE` to access the environment variables that start with `VITE_`.

I apologize for the confusion earlier.
